\title{
Pick up the combination of non-dimer primer sets.
}
\description{
In some case, the unique barcoded primers are less than the amount of samples. More primer sets can be generated by this function accoring the the number you specified. In this case, some primer (either forward or reverse) may occur more than than one time, which may lead to difficulty in demultiplexing the sequencing data. For technical reasons, this specified number should be less than 2 times of the unique barcode primer you have.
}
\usage{
pickmore(combi, n)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{combi}{
argument to specify the unique primer set which have been filtered by removing primer dimer conbinations.
}
  \item{n}{
numeric, a integer to specify the number of primer sets. For technical reasons, n should be less than 2 times of the number of unique pairs of initial barcoded primers.
}
}
\details{

}
\value{
The function will return a data frame of two columns. The 1st and 2nd columns show the identifiers of forward primer and reverse primer, respectively.
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use
%%  \item{comp1 }{Description of 'comp1'}
%%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}
