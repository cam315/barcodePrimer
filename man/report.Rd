\details{
This dataset were evaluated by the webtool 'Multiple Primer Analyzer' from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The 'parameters for detection of primer dimers' was set to '1', value 1 is maximum sensitive detection. This file include both 'Self-Dimers' and 'Cross Primer Dimers', indicating the primer dimers which may hamper the bining efficiency on template during PCR.
